# FEniCS-Python
Examples of Python scripts I wrote and used for the FEniCS chapter in my thesis, titled "[Modelling and analysis of paste flow in
high performance SÃ¸derberg electrodes](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:fe65fdfa-3765-4df0-a47b-47d499da0086)". 

In particular, they solve and validate CFD coupled models for velocity, pressure, and temperature. My aim was to have self-contained codes that could be run individually within a [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) framework.
