# # Axisymmetric formulation for elastic structures of revolution
# 
# In this numerical tour, we will deal with axisymmetric problems of elastic solids. We will consider a solid of revolution around a fixed axis $(Oz)$, the loading, boundary conditions and material properties being also invariant with respect to a rotation along the symmetry axis. The solid cross-section in a plane $\theta=\text{cst}$ will be represented by a two-dimensional domain $\omega$ for which the first spatial variable (`x[0]` in FEniCS) will represent the radial coordinate $r$ whereas the second spatial variable will denote the axial variable $z$.
# 
# ## Problem position
# 
# We will investigate here the case of a hollow hemisphere of inner (resp. outer) radius $R_i$ (resp. $R_e$). Due to the revolution symmetry, the 2D cross-section corresponds to a quarter of a hollow cylinder.

# ## Definition of axisymmetric strains
# 
# For axisymmetric conditions, the unkown displacement field is of the form:
# 
# $$\begin{equation}
# \boldsymbol{u} = u_r(r,z)\boldsymbol{e}_r + u_z(r,z)\boldsymbol{e}_z
# \end{equation}$$
# 
# As a result, we will work with a standard VectorFunctionSpace of dimension 2. The associated strain components are however given by:
# 
# $$\begin{equation}
# \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = \begin{bmatrix} \partial_r u_r & 0 & (\partial_z u_r + \partial_r u_z)/2 \\ 
# 0 & u_r/r & 0 \\
# (\partial_z u_r + \partial_r u_z)/2 & 0 & \partial_z u_z\end{bmatrix}_{(\boldsymbol{e}_r,\boldsymbol{e}_\theta,\boldsymbol{e}_z)}
# \end{equation}$$
# 
# The previous relation involves explicitly the radial variable $r$, which can be obtained from the SpatialCoordinate `x[0]`, the strain-displacement relation is then defined explicitly in the `eps` function.
# 
# > **Note**: we could also express the strain components in the form of a vector of size 4 in alternative of the 3D tensor representation implemented below.

    return sym(as_tensor([[v[0].dx(0), 0, v[0].dx(1)],
                          [0, v[0]/x[0], 0],
                          [v[1].dx(0), 0, v[1].dx(1)]]))

E = Constant(1e5)

# ## Resolution
# 
# The rest of the formulation is similar to the 2D elastic case with a small difference in the integration measure. Indeed, the virtual work principle reads as:
# 
# $$\begin{equation}
#  \text{Find } \boldsymbol{u}\in V \text{ s.t. } \int_{\Omega}
#  \boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u}):\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{v}) d\Omega
#  = \int_{\partial \Omega_T} \boldsymbol{T}\cdot\boldsymbol{v}  dS \quad \forall\boldsymbol{v} \in V
#  \end{equation}$$
#  
# where $\boldsymbol{T}$ is the imposed traction on some part $\partial \Omega_T$ of the domain boundary.
# 
# In axisymmetric conditions, the full 3D domain $\Omega$ can be decomposed as $\Omega = \omega \times [0;2\pi]$ where the interval represents the $\theta$ variable. The integration measures therefore reduce to $d\Omega = d\omega\cdot(rd\theta)$ and $dS = ds\cdot(rd\theta)$ where $dS$ is the surface integration measure on the 3D domain $\Omega$ and $ds$ its counterpart on the cross-section boundary $\partial \omega$. Exploiting the invariance of all fields with respect to $\theta$, the previous virtual work principle is reformulated on the cross-section only as follows:
# 
# $$\begin{equation}
#  \text{Find } \boldsymbol{u}\in V \text{ s.t. } \int_{\omega}
#  \boldsymbol{\sigma}(\boldsymbol{u}):\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\boldsymbol{v}) rd\omega
#  = \int_{\partial \omega_T} \boldsymbol{T}\cdot\boldsymbol{v}  rds \quad \forall\boldsymbol{v} \in V
#  \end{equation}$$
#  
# where the $2\pi$ constants arising from the integration on $\theta$ have been cancelled on both sides. As a result, the bilinear and linear form are similar to the plane 2D case with the exception of the additional $r$ term in the integration measures.
# 
# The final formulation is therefore pretty straightforward. Since a uniform pressure loading is applied on the outer boundary, we will also need the exterior normal vector to define the work of external forces form.
